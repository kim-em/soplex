  No-FFI lane: the verifier and tactic packages, with no SoPlex
  anywhere in the dependency graph.

  This file builds against `lp-core`, `lp-verify`, and `lp-tactic`,
  but NOT against `lp-backend-soplex-ffi` or `soplex-ffi`. A
  successful `lake build` here proves that the issue-50 split
  decoupled the verifier and tactic from the FFI backend: there is
  no `libsoplex`, no GMP, no Boost on the link line. A consumer who
  only wants to verify externally-produced certificates pays no
  build cost for SoPlex.

  We exercise enough of the API to keep the symbols live — if any
  module in the chain dragged in `SoplexFFI.Basic`, the link step
  would fail on the bare runner with a missing-library error. We do
  not call any solver, since by construction there is no backend
  registered in this build. -/
