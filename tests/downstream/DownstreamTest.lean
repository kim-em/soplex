import LP

/-!
Downstream-package smoke tests for the `lp` tactic.

These exist to catch the class of bug where `lp` works inside the
LP package but fails when invoked from a project that requires
LP as a dependency (e.g. due to FFI dylib resolution differences,
stale `.lake/packages/SoplexFFI` artefacts on a bump, or any other
in-tree-vs-downstream divergence).

The set of `(2*a+b ≤ k, a-b ≤ 1, 3*a ≤ k+1)` instances below covers
small two-row LPs whose Farkas certificate is the trivial `h₁ + h₂`
combination. These constants should verify from a downstream package,
matching the in-tree behavior instead of falling through as
`.unchecked .optimal`.
