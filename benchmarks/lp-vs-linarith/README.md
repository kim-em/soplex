# `lp` vs `linarith` — benchmark harness

A self-contained Lake project that compares LP's `lp` tactic against
Mathlib's `linarith` on dense linear-arithmetic goals over `Rat`. It lives
under the LP repo but is **not** built by default CI — it requires
Mathlib (for `linarith`), which LP itself deliberately does not depend
on. See [`REPORT.md`](./REPORT.md) for methodology and findings.

## Running

```bash
cd benchmarks/lp-vs-linarith
lake exe cache get          # fetch Mathlib's olean cache
lake build                  # build the test files (and Mathlib oleans)
./run.sh                    # single-seed (seed = N) timings, one row per (N, tactic)
./run-multi-seed.sh         # 5 seeds × all (N, tactic) with mean/min/max summary at the end
```

The first `lake build` will download the Mathlib cache (several thousand
files). After that, individual examples elaborate in seconds.

Generators take an optional third `seed` argument (default = N). The
committed `.lean` files use seed = N; the multi-seed runner generates
into the gitignored `LPvsLinarith/Seeded/` subdir at seeds 1..5.

```bash
# canonical (seed = N) file:
python3 generators/dense_integer.py 120 lp       > LPvsLinarith/IntN120LP.lean
python3 generators/dense_integer.py 120 linarith > LPvsLinarith/IntN120LA.lean

# multi-seed (explicit seed):
python3 generators/dense_integer.py 120 lp 3     > LPvsLinarith/Seeded/IntN120_lp_s3.lean
```
