Lean verified certificate checking for [SoPlex](https://soplex.zib.de/), the linear programming solver from the SCIP optimization suite.

This repository (`kim-em/soplex`) is the high-level Lean
meta-package. It sits on top of five dependencies:
[`kim-em/lp-core`](https://github.com/kim-em/lp-core) (pure-Lean LP
type vocabulary — `Problem`, `Options`, `Solution`, `Certificate`,
`SolveError`, plus the `LPBackend` record),
[`kim-em/lp-verify`](https://github.com/kim-em/lp-verify) (pure-Lean
certificate checker — `Verified`, `verifyOutcome`, soundness
lemmas), [`kim-em/lp-tactic`](https://github.com/kim-em/lp-tactic)
(the `by lp` and `maximize` tactics, the `LPBackend` registry, and
the `solveVerifiedWith` driver),
[`kim-em/lp-backend-soplex-ffi`](https://github.com/kim-em/lp-backend-soplex-ffi)
(the production-grade FFI adapter that registers under priority 10
and provides the synchronous `solveVerified` driver), and
[`kim-em/soplex-ffi`](https://github.com/kim-em/soplex-ffi) (the
vendored SoPlex build, the C++ FFI wrapper, and the direct Lean
bindings). On top of those, `Soplex` adds:

* a **pure-Lean certificate checker** (`Soplex.Verify`);
* `solveVerified`, a driver that runs SoPlex and validates its exact
  certificate against the original problem before returning a
  proof-carrying result;
* exact-mode and floating-point LP solves, plus MPS / LP file I/O
  (re-exported from `SoplexFFI`);
* fast user tactics `lp` (which handles quantifier elimination) and `maximize`.

## Composition

`by lp` and `solveVerifiedWith` dispatch through a backend registry
in `lp-tactic`. The meta-package bundles the FFI backend by
default, but other backends slot into the same registry. Depend
directly on one (instead of `Soplex`) if you want a slimmer build
graph:

- **[`kim-em/lp-backend-soplex-ffi`](https://github.com/kim-em/lp-backend-soplex-ffi)**
  (priority 10, the default). Production-grade native binding to
  the vendored SoPlex build; what `import Soplex` resolves to.
- **[`kim-em/lp-backend-soplex-json`](https://github.com/kim-em/lp-backend-soplex-json)**
  (priority 50, scaffold). Will drive an externally-installed
  `soplex` binary on `$PATH` through a JSON stdio protocol; the
  wire format is documented in the repository's
  `docs/json-contract.md`, but the encoder/decoder is not yet
  implemented — registering the package today gets the probe and
  the registry slot, not a working solver. Aimed at the "I've
  already got `brew install soplex`, don't rebuild it" case.
- **[`kim-em/lp-backend-pure`](https://github.com/kim-em/lp-backend-pure)**
  (priority 100, scaffold). Reserves the registry slot for a
  pure-Lean LP solver with zero native deps and zero subprocess
  calls. The simplex implementation has not landed yet, so
  registering the package today returns a structured "simplex
  not implemented" error from `solveExact`. When it does land,
  expect it to be slow on anything beyond toy LPs (exact-rational
  simplex pays for the verifier's exact-rational input contract);
  the point is zero-install CI lanes and demos.

Per-call backend selection happens through the registry; importing
multiple backend packages is fine, the lowest-priority one with a
successful probe wins. See
[`kim-em/lp-tactic`](https://github.com/kim-em/lp-tactic) for the
registry surface.

## Quickstart

Add `Soplex` to your `lakefile.lean`:

```lean
require Soplex from git "https://github.com/kim-em/soplex" @ "main"
```

This example maximizes `3 x₀ + 5 x₁` subject to
`x₀ ≤ 4`, `2 x₁ ≤ 12`, `3 x₀ + 2 x₁ ≤ 18`, and `x₀, x₁ ≥ 0`
(textbook example; optimum is `x = (2, 6)` with objective `36`):

```lean
import Soplex
open Soplex Soplex.Verify

-- Proving theorems via `lp` is usually faster than Mathlib's `linarith`.
example (x₀ x₁ : Rat) (_ : x₀ ≤ 4) (_ : 2 * x₁ ≤ 12) (_ : 3 * x₀ + 2 * x₁ ≤ 18)
    (_ : 0 ≤ x₀) (_ : 0 ≤ x₁) : 3 * x₀ + 5 * x₁ ≤ 36 := by lp

-- The tactic also solves linear arithmetic problems involving quantifiers.
example : ∃ x : Rat, 0 ≤ x ∧ x ≤ 3 ∧
    ∀ y : Rat, x ≤ y → y ≤ 5 → y ≤ 2 * x := by lp

-- The library can also generate certificates for linear programming problems:

def lp : Problem 3 2 :=
  { c         := #v[3, 5]
    a         := #[(0, 0, 1), (1, 1, 2), (2, 0, 3), (2, 1, 2)]
    rowBounds := #v[(none, some 4), (none, some 12), (none, some 18)]
    colBounds := #v[(some 0, none), (some 0, none)] }

def main : IO Unit := do
  match solveVerified (opts := { sense := .maximize }) lp with
  | .error e  => IO.println s!"solve failed: {repr e}"
  | .ok r =>
    match r.verified with
    | .optimal x h =>
      -- `h.1 : IsFeasible r.normalized x.toArray`
      -- `h.2 : IsOptimal  r.normalized .maximize x.toArray`
      let _ := h
      IO.println s!"optimal x = {repr x.toArray}"
    | .infeasible _    => IO.println "infeasible (with Lean proof)"
    | .unbounded _ _ _ => IO.println "unbounded (with Lean proof)"
    | .unchecked s     => IO.println s!"unchecked: {repr s}"
```

Key shape:

* `Problem m n` is indexed by `m` constraints and `n` variables, so
  every array has its size pinned in the type. `c`, `rowBounds`,
  `colBounds` are `Vector`s; `a` is a sparse `(row, col, value)` list.
* `rowBounds` and `colBounds` are `(lo, hi)` pairs with `none = ±∞`,
  covering `≤`, `=`, `≥`, ranged constraints, and boxed variables
  uniformly.
* `solveVerified` returns a `VerifiedSolve` whose `verified` field is
  either a constructor carrying a real Lean soundness proof
  (`.optimal x h`, `.infeasible h`, `.unbounded x r h`) or
  `.unchecked status` when SoPlex was undecided or the certificate
  failed to check.

This example is kept in [`Examples/Quickstart.lean`](./Examples/Quickstart.lean)
and built as `lake exe quickstart-example` so it stays in sync with
the API. See [`Examples/`](./Examples/) for the examples index.

## Tactics

The verified pipeline is exposed as two `Rat`-affine tactics that
build kernel proof terms — no `Problem`/`Certificate` data reaches the
kernel, only a weighted-sum-of-hypotheses identity discharged by an
explicit-proof-term constructor.

### `lp` 

```lean
import Soplex

example : (1 : Rat) < 2 := by lp

example (a b : Rat) (_ : 2 * a + b ≤ 5) (_ : a - b ≤ 1) :
    3 * a ≤ 6 := by lp

example (a : Rat) (_ : a ≤ 0 ∧ 0 ≤ a) : a = 0 := by lp

example (x : Rat) (_ : x ≤ 0) : x < 1 := by lp

example : ∃ x : Rat, 0 ≤ x ∧ x ≤ 1 := by lp

example : ∃ x : Rat, ∀ y : Rat, 0 ≤ y → y ≤ 1 → x ≥ y := by lp

example : ∃ x : Rat, 0 ≤ x ∧ x ≤ 3 ∧
    ∀ y : Rat, x ≤ y → y ≤ 5 → y ≤ 2 * x := by lp
```

Hypotheses that are not non-strict `Rat`-affine are silently ignored
(strict hypotheses are rejected with a tactic-level diagnostic). When
SoPlex returns infeasible, `lp` derives `False` from the dual and
closes any goal.

`lp` handles a Π₂ fragment of linear rational arithmetic. Atoms are
`Rat`-affine (in)equalities (`≤`, `<`, `=`, `≥`, `>`) in the
`Rat`-typed locals; these combine under `∧`, under `∃ x : Rat`, and
under inner `∀ y : Rat, g₁ → … → gₖ → b` whose guards `gᵢ` and body
`b` are themselves `Rat`-affine atoms — including guards that mention
the outer existential witness. The local context contributes
non-strict linear `Rat` hypotheses; SoPlex serves as an untrusted
oracle for Farkas / dual multipliers, and the kernel proof is
reconstructed from those multipliers and the original hypothesis
terms.

### `maximize` 

`maximize <expr>` runs a sup-LP over the local hypotheses and injects
`hbound : <expr> ≤ N` where `N` is the certified maximum. Use
`maximize h : <expr>` to choose the hypothesis name.

```lean
example (x₀ x₁ : Rat) (_ : 0 ≤ x₀) (_ : 0 ≤ x₁) (_ : x₀ ≤ 4)
    (_ : 2 * x₁ ≤ 12) (_ : 3 * x₀ + 2 * x₁ ≤ 18) :
    3 * x₀ + 5 * x₁ ≤ 36 := by
  maximize 3 * x₀ + 5 * x₁
  exact hbound

example (x : Rat) (_ : 0 ≤ x) (_ : x ≤ 4) : 3 * x + 7 ≤ 19 := by
  maximize h : 3 * x + 7
  exact h
```

If hypotheses are inconsistent, `maximize` closes the surrounding
goal by `False.elim`. If the LP is unbounded above, it fails without
producing a proof.

## Benchmarks

Performance comparisons of `by lp` against Mathlib's `linarith`, plus
the multi-carrier sweep over `Rat` / `Int` / `Dyadic` / `Nat` / `Real`,
live in [`kim-em/soplex-benchmark`](https://github.com/kim-em/soplex-benchmark).
On the same `ℚ` goals `lp` runs about 2x faster than `linarith`, and the
native computable carriers (`Int`, `Dyadic`, `Nat`) beat the `Rat`
baseline.

## Build

Pinned SoPlex tag: **`v8.0.2`** (transitive via `SoplexFFI`). Pinned
Lean toolchain: see [`lean-toolchain`](./lean-toolchain).

System dependencies:

| Platform | Packages |
|----------|----------|
| Linux    | `build-essential cmake libgmp-dev libgmpxx4ldbl libboost-dev` |
| macOS    | `brew install gmp boost cmake` (plus Xcode Command Line Tools) |
| Windows  | MSYS2 `mingw-w64-x86_64-{gcc,cmake,ninja,make,gmp,boost}` |

Clone and build through Lake:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kim-em/soplex
cd soplex
lake exe quickstart-example
lake test
```

Lake fetches `SoplexFFI` and initializes its vendored SoPlex submodule
as part of the build — there are no submodules in this repository
itself.

`quickstart-example` runs the verified solve from the
[Quickstart](#quickstart) above and prints `optimal x = #[2, 6]`.
`lake test` builds and runs the full test suite under
[`SoplexTest/`](./SoplexTest). The suite includes
`SoplexTest/FFIProbe.lean`, which calls `solveVerified` from inside a
tactic and checks the elaboration-time FFI loading path used by future
tactics. For a lower-level FFI-only check
(SoPlex version, throw/catch ABI, small LP sanity check via the direct
binding) use `lake exe ffi-check`.

The first Lake build is slow (~1–3 min) because the `SoplexFFI`
dependency configures and compiles vendored SoPlex with CMake.
Subsequent runs are nearly instant: CMake reuses its cache, and Lake
only rebuilds the FFI wrapper or extracted SoPlex objects when their
inputs change.

## Trust model

SoPlex is treated as an unverified mathematical oracle. Every exact
certificate it produces is checked in Lean before any proof is
constructed. Incorrect certificates, including certificates affected by
solver bugs or sign-convention translation mistakes, are rejected by
the Lean checker and reported as `Verified.unchecked`.

The native C++ FFI remains part of the runtime trusted computing base.
It is trusted to run safely in-process, preserve memory safety and ABI
correctness, and faithfully marshal Lean-side `Problem` and
certificate data. The Lean checker protects the mathematical proof
boundary; it does not make arbitrary native memory-safety or ABI
failures harmless.

Detailed notes on `solveVerified`, presolve, dual multipliers,
maximization canonicalization, and denominator budgets are maintained
in [`docs/verification.md`](./docs/verification.md).
