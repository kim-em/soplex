/-! # `lean-soplex` build configuration

  Two Lake libraries:

  * `LeanSoplexVerify` — pure-Lean certificate checker
    (`LeanSoplex.Verify` namespace). No FFI dependency, so consumers
    that only want the verifier can depend on this target alone.
  * `LeanSoplex`       — FFI bindings to SoPlex.

  A single `extern_lib leansoplex` packages SoPlex's object files
  together with the bridge's object files into one static library.
  Package-level `moreLinkArgs` adds the runtime library dependencies
  (GMP, the C++ runtime) that are not bundled in.

  Mirrors `kim-em/lean-csdp`'s pattern. Differences:

  * SoPlex is C++ (CSDP is C); bridge files are `.cpp`.
  * SoPlex is too large to compile file-by-file from Lake, and its
    build needs CMake. Lake's job system is not a comfortable home for
    multi-step out-of-tree builds, so SoPlex is built via the
    `scripts/build-soplex.sh` helper instead. Run it once before
    `lake build` (CI does this automatically). The script writes
    `.lake/build/soplex-objs/.ready` once SoPlex's object files have
    been extracted; the lakefile reads that directory at build time.

/-! ## Platform-specific link arguments. -/

/-- Path to the macOS Command Line Tools SDK. Hard-coded for the same
    reason as in `lean-csdp`: Lake's configuration phase has no clean
    way to call `xcrun` at load time, and the CLT SDK is the most
    universally available path across user machines and CI runners. -/
def macSdkPath : String :=
  "/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk"

/-- Linker arguments for SoPlex's runtime library dependencies.

    * SoPlex itself is built into the combined static library by the
      `extern_lib leansoplex` rule below, so it does not appear here.
    * GMP (with the `libgmpxx` C++ wrappers) is required for exact-
      rational arithmetic and is dynamically linked.
    * `-lstdc++` / `-lc++` pulls in the C++ runtime. Lean's linker
      driver (`clang`) does not infer that from the presence of `.cpp`
      objects, so we add it explicitly.
    * macOS: route the linker at the Command Line Tools SDK so the
      `--sysroot` Lake sets does not hide the system libraries.
    * Windows (MSYS2 / mingw-w64): GMP / runtime libs are staged into
      `vendor/mingw-libs/` by CI; `-L` points there as well as the
      standard MSYS2 install path. -/

    -- SoPlex's pre-built `.o` files (compiled by mingw's `g++`) and our
    -- bridge `.o` (compiled by Lake's `c++`, also mingw `g++`) both
    -- emit libstdc++-mangled symbols. The `libstdc++.dll.a` *import lib*
    -- in our staging directory carries pre-cxx11-ABI imports only, so
    -- the C++11-ABI symbols SoPlex uses (`std::__cxx11::basic_string<…>`
    -- and friends) are never satisfied by `-lstdc++`. We therefore pass
    -- the *static* archive `libstdc++.a` directly by relative path —
    -- this avoids any ambiguity with `-Wl,-Bstatic` and any reordering
    -- Lake may do, and the static archive contains the full C++11 ABI.
    -- Same trick for `libgmpxx.a` / `libgmp.a`. `libgcc_s` and `msvcrt`
    -- (the latter for `__declspec(dllimport) _vsnprintf`) stay dynamic.
    -- Lean's `clang.exe` on Windows auto-links `libc++.a` regardless
    -- of `-stdlib=libstdc++` or `-nostdlib++` flags (it's in MSVC-style
    -- mode where those driver flags are reported "unused"). Both
    -- libc++ and our explicit libstdc++ define every C++ standard
    -- exception type, so the link fails with duplicate symbols.
    --
    -- `--allow-multiple-definition` is a pragmatic hack: lld picks
    -- whichever definition it sees first. For `std::bad_alloc`,
    -- `std::exception`, and friends the libc++ and libstdc++
    -- implementations are functionally equivalent, but the vtable
    -- layouts may differ. SoPlex's mingw-built objects link first,
    -- so libstdc++ wins, and libc++'s definitions are dropped on the
    -- floor. This may produce subtle runtime issues if any libc++
    -- object survives in the final DLL and tries to use a libc++
    -- vtable — but for an FFI shim that doesn't use C++ types across
    -- the API boundary, it should be sufficient.
    --
    -- A cleaner long-term fix is to compile SoPlex with libc++ from
    -- the start, so the entire DLL uses one C++ ABI.
