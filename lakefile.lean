/-! # `lean-soplex` build configuration

  Two Lake libraries:

  * `LeanSoplexVerify` — pure-Lean certificate checker
    (`LeanSoplex.Verify` namespace). No FFI dependency, so consumers
    that only want the verifier can depend on this target alone.
  * `LeanSoplex`       — FFI bindings to SoPlex.

  A single `extern_lib leansoplex` packages SoPlex's object files
  together with the bridge's object files into one static library.
  Package-level `moreLinkArgs` adds the runtime library dependencies
  (GMP, the C++ runtime) that are not bundled in.

  Mirrors `kim-em/lean-csdp`'s pattern. Differences:

  * SoPlex is C++ (CSDP is C); bridge files are `.cpp`.
  * SoPlex is too large to compile file-by-file from Lake, and its
    build needs CMake. Lake's job system is not a comfortable home for
    multi-step out-of-tree builds, so SoPlex is built via the
    `scripts/build-soplex.sh` helper instead. Run it once before
    `lake build` (CI does this automatically). The script writes
    `.lake/build/soplex-objs/.ready` once SoPlex's object files have
    been extracted; the lakefile reads that directory at build time.

/-! ## Platform-specific link arguments. -/

/-- Path to the macOS Command Line Tools SDK. Hard-coded for the same
    reason as in `lean-csdp`: Lake's configuration phase has no clean
    way to call `xcrun` at load time, and the CLT SDK is the most
    universally available path across user machines and CI runners. -/
def macSdkPath : String :=
  "/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk"

/-- Linker arguments for SoPlex's runtime library dependencies.

    * SoPlex itself is built into the combined static library by the
      `extern_lib leansoplex` rule below, so it does not appear here.
    * GMP (with the `libgmpxx` C++ wrappers) is required for exact-
      rational arithmetic and is dynamically linked.
    * `-lstdc++` / `-lc++` pulls in the C++ runtime. Lean's linker
      driver (`clang`) does not infer that from the presence of `.cpp`
      objects, so we add it explicitly.
    * macOS: route the linker at the Command Line Tools SDK so the
      `--sysroot` Lake sets does not hide the system libraries.
    * Windows (MSYS2 / mingw-w64): GMP / runtime libs are staged into
      `vendor/mingw-libs/` by CI; `-L` points there as well as the
      standard MSYS2 install path. -/
