  Whenever `solveVerified lp` returns `.optimal x h`, the witness `x`
  is a certified feasible and optimal point of the normalised LP. The
  proof is built into the `.optimal` constructor itself; this lemma
  just exposes the API contract.

  See [issue #N] for an `lp` tactic that would let us state and prove
  a fully pure-`Rat` version of this in a single line.
