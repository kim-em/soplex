# `lp` Proof Construction

This document describes where the `lp` tactic constructs Lean
proof-facing `Expr` values in `LP/Tactic/LP.lean`, and which
construction sites are intentionally delayed until a successful
certificate needs them.

## `LP/Tactic/LP.lean`

| Site | Role | Construction cost | Design |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `collectHypProof`: `And.left` / `And.right` projections | Needed to inspect conjunctive hypotheses. | One projection per conjunct edge; small and proportional to parsed context shape. | Left eager. |
| `collectHypProof`: row `lhs - rhs` terms | Needed only for rows whose dual/Farkas multiplier is nonzero. Rows ignored by the certificate do not need the term. | One `HSub.hSub` elaboration per parsed row; noticeable on dense contexts with many unused rows. | Made lazy as `Row.term : MetaM Expr`. |
| `collectHypProof`: row proofs (`rat_sub_nonpos_of_le`, `rat_sub_nonpos_of_eq`, `mkEqSymm`) | Needed only for rows whose multiplier is nonzero. | One closer application per used row; equality's reverse row additionally needs `mkEqSymm`. | Already lazy as `Row.proof : MetaM Expr`; retained. |
| `solveAtomic`: parsed goal-side `LinExpr`s from `parseAtomic?` | Needed to discover goal variables before calling `proveEntailed`; equality goals reuse the same parse to seed both directions. | Numeric parse plus reducible whnf; no proof-term construction. | Left eager. |
| `proveEntailed`: objective `rhs - lhs` `LinExpr` | Needed to detect the closed-goal short-circuit and to build the LP objective. | Numeric parse; no proof-term construction. | Left eager. |
| `proveEntailed`: dense row arrays and row constants | Needed only if the closed-goal short-circuit does not fire and SoPlex is called. | Numeric, not `Expr`, but can dominate large closed goals by walking all rows. | Moved after the short-circuit. |
| `assembleLeProof`: residual sign proof, `rhs - lhs`, weighted sum, identity, final closer | Needed only on the optimal/closed-goal path after numerical checks pass. | Proportional to nonzero certificate rows plus identity size. | Already branch-local. |
| `proveEntailed` infeasible branch: Farkas residual, weighted sum, identity, `False.elim` goal type | Needed only when SoPlex reports infeasible. | Proportional to nonzero Farkas rows plus identity size. | Already branch-local; row term forcing now lazy. |
| `proveEntailed` unbounded branch: diagnostic strings | Needed only for the unbounded error. | String-only, no proof `Expr`. | Left branch-local. |
| `solveGoal`: `And.intro` and child metavariables | Needed only for conjunctive goals. | Small per goal split. | Left branch-local. |

The key proof-construction invariant is that parsed rows carry only
numeric data eagerly. Lean proof-side row artefacts are forced at
certificate assembly time and only for rows with nonzero multipliers.
